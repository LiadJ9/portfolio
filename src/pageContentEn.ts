# Welcome 👋


I am liad Manteka and I'm a **Frontend oriented Fullstack developer** from Israel.


I am currently working at [Dive Health](https://www.divehealth.co/) as the **lead Frontend developer**, where I’m responsible for almost everything, from the architecture and CSS/HTML, to designing reusable components, and implementing the core logic behind every new feature,


from the architecture of every feature we implement, CSS and HTML, Designing reusable components, to the functional logic of every new feature we implement.
I also dabble in infrastrcture and backend development, mostly working with lambdas and other microservices.

### 💬 [Phoenix/Elixir Messenger](https://pheonix-liveview-local-messager.gigalixirapp.com/chat/0423a435-bff0-47d8-afeb-866041c739f6)

![Phoenix messenger](${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}public/pheonix_msg.webp)

A real-time messaging app built with **Phoenix LiveView**, supporting multiple users and fun slash commands like '/clock' and '/weather'.

This was created in 3 days in part of trying to get a better understanding of other approaches to web development,
that are not just react or other frameworks, as I think it's important to broaden your horizons when things get a little stale.
